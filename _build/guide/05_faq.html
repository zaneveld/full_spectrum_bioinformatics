<p>The following are some common issues and questions that have arisen when
building your textbook with Jekyll.</p>
<h2 id="How-can-I-update-my-book?">How can I update my book?<a class="anchor-link" href="#How-can-I-update-my-book?"> </a></h2><p>Sometimes Jupyter Book will get updates that you want to incorporate into
a book you've already built. The easiest way to do this is to use the Command-Line Interface to
upgrade your book.</p>
<p>To upgrade a pre-existing Jupyter Book, run the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>jupyter-book upgrade path/to/mybook
</pre></div>
<p>This will do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generate a fresh Jupyter Book in <code>mybook_UPGRADED</code> using the content files in your
current book.</li>
<li>If this succeeds, copy over the contents of <code>mybook_UPGRADED</code> into your current book folder.</li>
<li>If this succeeds, delete the <code>mybook_UPGRADED</code> folder.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that only the content that you can manually specify via the <code>jupyter-book create</code> command
will be retained in your upgraded book. For a list of these options, see the help menu for this command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>jupyter-book create -h
</pre></div>
<p>You should check out the content in your upgraded book to make sure it looks correct, then
commit the changes to your repository.</p>
<h2 id="Does-the-book-behave-differently-depending-on-the-browser?">Does the book behave differently depending on the browser?<a class="anchor-link" href="#Does-the-book-behave-differently-depending-on-the-browser?"> </a></h2><p>Maybe - Jupyter Book does use some features that might have different behaviors in
some browsers. For example, Safari <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book/pull/104#issuecomment-462461188">tends to treat downloadable objects</a>
differently for some reason.</p>
<p>The two browsers on which Jupyter Book should always behave as expected are
<strong>Firefox</strong> and <strong>Chrome</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Why-isn't-my-math-showing-up-properly?">Why isn't my math showing up properly?<a class="anchor-link" href="#Why-isn't-my-math-showing-up-properly?"> </a></h2><p>This book uses MathJax to render all math, with <code>$</code> denoting inline math,
and <code>$$</code> denoting multi-line math blocks. Make sure that all of your math
is wrapped in these characters.</p>
<p>Another tip is to remember to use <strong>escape characters</strong> when you <em>don't</em> want
math to be rendered and instead want an actual dollar sign to show up.
To do so, simply add a <code>\</code> in front of the dollar sign. For example, I
can write \$35 by writing it like `\\$35` in the markdown.</p>
<h2 id="How-can-I-include-interactive-Plotly-figures?">How can I include interactive Plotly figures?<a class="anchor-link" href="#How-can-I-include-interactive-Plotly-figures?"> </a></h2><p>To display interactive <a href="https://plot.ly/python/">Plotly</a> figures, they must
first be generated in a Jupyter notebook using the <a href="https://plot.ly/python/offline/">offline mode</a>.
You must then plot the figure with <code>plotly.offline.plot()</code>, which generates an HTML file (<code>plotly.offline.iplot()</code> does not),
and then load the HTML into the notebook with <code>display(HTML('file.html'))</code> prior to saving your *.ipynb file.</p>
<p>e.g.</p>

<pre><code>from IPython.core.display import display, HTML
from plotly.offline import init_notebook_mode, plot
init_notebook_mode(connected=True)
.
.
.
plot(fig, filename = 'figure.html')
display(HTML('figure.html')</code></pre>
<p>Note that, if viewing the file on a Jupyter Notebook session, the figure will not be displayed there (<code>iplot</code> is needed for this). However, if working on a <a href="https://github.com/binder-examples/jupyterlab">JupyterLab</a> session, the figure can be displayed there using the <code>plot</code> code above by having the <a href="https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-renderers/tree/master/packages/plotly-extension">JupyterLab plotly extension</a> installed.</p>
<h2 id="What-if-I-have-an-issue-or-question?">What if I have an issue or question?<a class="anchor-link" href="#What-if-I-have-an-issue-or-question?"> </a></h2><p>If you've got questions, concerns, or suggestions, please open an issue at
<a href="https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book/issues">at the jupyter book issues page</a></p>
<h2 id="How-should-I-add-cell-tags-to-my-notebooks?">How should I add cell tags to my notebooks?<a class="anchor-link" href="#How-should-I-add-cell-tags-to-my-notebooks?"> </a></h2><p>You can control the behavior of Jupyter Book by putting custom tags
in the metadata of your cells. This allows you to do things like
<a href="../features/hiding">automatically hide code cells</a> as well as
<a href="../features/interactive_cells">adding interactive widgets to cells</a>.</p>
<p>There are two straightforward ways to add metadata to cells:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Use the Jupyter Notebook cell tag editor</strong>. The Jupyter Notebook ships with a
cell tag editor by default. This lets you add cell tags to each cell quickly.</p>
<p>To enable the cell tag editor, go click <code>View -&gt; Cell Toolbar -&gt; Tags</code>. This
will enable the tags UI. Here's what the menu looks like.</p>
<p><img src="../images/tags_notebook.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Use the JupyterLab Cell Tags plugin</strong>. JupyterLab is an IDE-like Jupyter
environment that runs in your browser. It has a rich extension ecosystem.
A particularly useful extension
<a href="https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-celltags">is the "cell tags" plugin</a>,
which exposes a user interface that lets you quickly insert cell tags.</p>
<p>You can install the cell tags plugin with the following command (after installing
JupyterLab).</p>

<pre><code>jupyter labextension install @jupyterlab/celltags</code></pre>
<p>Then, you'll find tags under the "wrench" menu section.
Here's what the tags UI in JupyterLab looks like.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Why-doesn't-math-show-properly-when-printing?">Why doesn't math show properly when printing?<a class="anchor-link" href="#Why-doesn't-math-show-properly-when-printing?"> </a></h2><p>Currently, we use a library called <a href="https://printjs.crabbly.com/">PrintJS</a> to handle
printing of <em>just</em> the notebook content (when you click the "print -&gt; PDF" buttons).</p>
<p>However, a drawback of this approach is that MathJax mathematics cannot access the
same fonts available when you're viewing a page live. This means that mathematics often
look simplified and incorrectly-formatted.</p>
<p>If you have an idea for how to improve this, please
