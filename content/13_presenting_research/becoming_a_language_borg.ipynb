    "In Star Trek: The Next Generation, the Borg are cybernetic aliens that adopt the technology and knowledge of other species and cultures through a sinister process called Assimilation. When writing about our science, we won't be injecting other scientists with nanoprobes or robotically stating that \"Resistance is Futile.\" But as scientific communicators we do want to learn from and assimilate successful communication strategies used by others. In doing so, we can benefit from thinking just a little bit like The Borg."

    "## Templating\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we'll talk about a strategy called **templating** we can use to improve our writing. We'll talk about it mostly in the context of scientific writing, but its a useful way to analyze and understand writing techniques in any domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of templating is to take a specific example of effective scientific writing, then to abstract it into a general pattern that could be used in many different contexts, and finally to practice generating your own writing using that pattern. Let's break down each of these steps in turn:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify** a source. In this step, we'll find a piece of language — a sentence, paragraph, or maybe even whole chapter — that we find really clear or compelling. If you've been following along in this text, you could go back to some of the papers you liked best from your literature review, and re-read them to focus in on specific explanations that you liked.  It's a good idea to record citation info and a link to your source so you can find it later.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Study** the source. Write down some general notes about what you appreciate about the source writing, and what yout hink makes it effective. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Abstract** the source into a template. In this step, we'll try to understand what makes our source writing work. We'll then try to write a template that substitutes specific details of the language with more general placeholders. I usually use square brackets to indicate these placeholders. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Produce** your own examples. In this step you'll use your template to produce new writing about topics that aren't related to your source. If you're working on a bioinformatic project of your own, you might use these productions to experiment with where you could use this language strucutre in your own writing. Sometimes it's helpful to include an extra sentence or two for context. I find it most helpful to come up with two or three of these, just to get this new language pattern into muscle memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps will be much clearer when you see them applied to a few examples."

    "## Example 1. From [Hsiao et al., 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24315484/), \"Microbiota modulate behavioral and physiological abnormalities associated with neurodevelopmental disorders\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Source \n",
    "\n",
    "The authors of [Hsiao et al 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3897394/) have already given background on neurodivergence, and gastrointestinal (GI) disorders in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). They are investigating a mouse maternal immune activation (MIA) model for how this happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Subsets of ASD children are reported to display GI abnormalities, including increased intestinal permeability or “leaky gut” (D’Eufemia et al., 1996; de Magistris et al., 2010; Ibrahim et al., 2009) ... Consistent with the leaky gut phenotype, colons from adult MIA offspring contain decreased gene expression of ZO-1, ZO-2, OCLN and CLDN8, and increased expression of CLDN15 (Figure 1B). Deficient expression of ZO-1 is also observed in small intestines of adult MIA offspring (Figure S1A), demonstrating a widespread defect in intestinal barrier integrity. Gut permeability is commonly associated with an altered immune response (Turner, 2009)\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "This passage is somewhat dense. I've added elipses (...) to focus in on the part I thought was most interesting, but the whole paper is worth reading. Some things I noticed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The authors start a results section with background. This is a little unusual, and might get pushback from reviewers at some journals, but I found myself *really* liking it as a reader. Each section of results is sandwiched betweeen a couple of sentences of mini-intro and a sentence of mini-discussion that contextualizes the results and compares them to other literature. I found this very effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The authors say up-front what they think the relevance of their gene expression results are, before showing the results themselves. This might also be mildy controversial, since some argue that it is better to first share objective results, let readers formulate their own thoughts, and only subsequently include the authors interpretations. I'm sympathetic to that view, but in this case I think giving context for the significance of increased expression of genes like ZO-1 (which many non-specialist readers may not recognize) is helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Templates\n",
    "\n",
    "I tried to think about how I could generalize this strategy overall, as well as studying more specific structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Really specific template for the key sentence:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Consistent with [hypothesis], [description of samples] show [result].\n",
    "\n",
    "Really broad template at a whole-paragraph scale:\n",
    "\n",
    "    [Sentence citing previous knowledge on topic to support why they are testing a particular hypothesis]. [Sentence discussing the result]. [Sentence further showing how results distribute in subsets of the data]. [Sentence linking out to these results to the next part of the story, using citations to the literature to connect teh two].\n",
    "    \n",
    " \n",
    " ### Productions\n",
    " \n",
    " ##### 1.\n",
    " ##### 2.\n",
    " ##### 3.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " Next I tried writing some example sentences. Here I'll focus more on the detailed sentence since the examples are more concise. In each, I tried to think about how this structure might relate to topics I sometimes talk about in my own research and teaching. I won't necessarily use these right away, but am generating them in order to get different ways of writing about science into 'muscle memory'.\n",
    " \n",
    "     Consistent with the hypothesis that both top-down ecological pressures are critical in shaping reef communities, reef patches from which large herbivorous fishes were excluded became dominated by macroalgae\n",
    "     \n",
    "     Consistent with strong and specific habitat-filtering by different parts of coral anatomy, coral mucus, tissue and skeleton show dramatic differences in alpha-diversity, beta-diversity, and correlation with host vs. environmental parameters.  \n",
    "     \n",
    "     Consistent with the prediction that non-phylogenetic methods will show poor performance in cross-species comparisons because they fail to account for the correlation structure of the tree, simulated microbiomes with no correlations between host traits and microbiome beta-diversity nonethless showed many highly significant false positive correlations when analyzed by PERMANOVA.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     \n",
    "     \n",
    "None of these examples are perfect, but they help me to think about ways I might use this structure in my own writing. I probably won't use any directly, but I might glance at a list of templates I've worked up from time to time before I start to write. This can help me avoid falling into the same patterns over and over in writing. \n",

We note that this is a common analysis approach for genome-wide association data, driven by the rationale that complex traits are controlled by multiple genetic effects, which could originate in different genes, but are likely to aggregate in the same biological pathway or function.\"\n",

    "## Templating vs. Plagiarism\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've had any instruction on academic writing, you know that it's critical to write in your own words and to cite your sources. Directly copying anyone else's language into an academic text is plagiarism. However, it is normal and extremely important to learn from effective writing, including by emulating language structures deployed by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "This might seem like a contradiction, but in fact follows a pretty clear pattern. An example from art might be helpful to clarify. If I like Van Gogh's \"Starry Night\", paint an exact replica, and then try to pass it off as my original work, that's plagiarism. If I like Van Gogh's \"Starry Night\", study the style and techniques that make the painting work and then try to apply them in my own work, that's templating.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way the main difference between unethical plagiarism and templating is in the *degree of abstraction*. Instead of unethically using someone's exact words (often without understanding them very well), we're instead seeking to understand and assimilate the language structure underneath those words.\n",
    "\n",
    "In truth, I almost never use these templates or the productions from them *directly* when writing, but instead find that the act of writing them down and glancing at them from time to time helps to remind me of the toolbox of different ways an idea *could* be written. "
