    "Slides presented at a research conference often undergo multiple rounds of revision. Typically, a first round happens after presenting a proposed presentation to a mentor, followed by a second round after presenting to a lab or research group. With more experience, you may be able to make many adjustments on your own before receiving feedback, but at first it's really useful to consult with folks familiar with conventions for scientific talks.\n",

    "\n",
    "To make things fair, each image will contain only the same image (Figure 1 from Epstein et al), though some will use crop, duplicate, etc to set things up nicely.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each 'taste test', you can try to answer three questions: \n",
    "   - what do you notice is different between the versions? \n",
    "   - which version do I prefer? \n",
    "   - why does the version you like better seem more effective?\n",
