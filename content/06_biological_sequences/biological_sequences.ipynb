    "#### Sequences in Biology\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first review some of the biology of DNA, RNA and Protein sequences. Those already familiar with basic molecular biology and the Central Dogma should skim down to the heading on how to represent biological sequences in text. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The Central Dogma**\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow of information between different types of biological sequences is important in the biology of cells. The [Central Dogma of molecular biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology) is a statement of which routes of information transmission are typical, which are rare, and which never happen. \n",
    "\n",
    "In cellular organisms, DNA forms the genome. That genome can be replicated by proteins called DNA polymerases to generate new copies of itself during reproduction. This replication is not perfect, and can introduce random changes in the DNA (mutations), which are an important source of variation among organisms. But overall DNA replication is quite accurate on average under normal circumstances. A key feature of DNA replication is that it is  *semi-conservative*. This means that each two stranded copy of the original two-stranded DNA genome contains one newly synthesized strand and one of the parental strands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some DNA forms genes. These contain the information needed to form the sequence of a protein (or, more rarely, a functional RNA). But proteins are not produced from DNA directly. DNA must first be **transcribed** into RNA before translation can occur.  Critically, each gene is transcibed at different rates under different conditions and at different points in time. This is important because cells in our liver and in our eye both inherit the same DNA. The main reason these tissues are so different is due to differences in which genes are transcribed into RNA (and therefore can be translated into protein).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, RNA can be **translated** into Protein in a structure with both protein and RNA elements called a ribosome. Much as with transcription, not *all* RNAs are translated into protein (this is known as **translational regulation**). In the ribosome, 3 letter codes in the RNA (known as **codons**) guide the addition of new **amino acids** to a new protein. \n",
    "\n",
    "A key tenant of the central dogma is that once proteins are formed, information does not flow backwards to RNA or DNA. That is, while proteins can be generated from the information in DNA or RNA in the cell, the opposite is not true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider each of the types of sequences involved in the Central Dogma in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nucleotide sequences**\n",
    "* DNA\n",
    "* RNA\n",
    "\n",
    "Nucleotide sequences include DNA and RNA. Although DNA and RNA can differ by only a single hydroxyl group in chemical structure, they play very different roles in the cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "**DNA** For cellular organisms (and some but not all viruses) the genome is formed by one or more chromosomes of double-stranded DNA. DNA can be thought of as a form of stable long-term storage of genetic information -- very loosly analagous to a computer's hard drive. The DNA is composed of **nucleotides**, which are often abbreviated `nt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The double-stranded string of DNA nucleotides has some **coding regions** that encode the information needed to put together proteins. Other regions are **non-coding regions**. While much non-coding DNA may have no specific benefit to the cell, other non-coding sequences hold important information such as sites where specific proteins or protein complexes should bind to the DNA to do things like starting DNA replication or transcribing a particular gene in the DNA into RNA. Broadly speaking, mammals like humans tend to have far more non-coding DNA than single celled organisms, which in turn tend to have more non-coding DNA than viruses. This is thought to be both because carrying extra DNA is a greater burdan on fast-reproducing organisms, and also because the larger population sizes of viruses or bacteria may allow for 'streamlining' of the genome to remove unneeded non-coding regions, even though the cost of carrying them is minimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The word **gene** refer to any sequences of DNA that encode an RNA. **Protein-coding genes** encode RNAs that go on to serve as the basis for manufacture of a protein. **Non-protein-coding genes** encode RNAs that serve other functions in the cell. Thus, all **coding-regions** are genes, but not all **genes** are coding regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RNA** plays several roles in cells. The most common is to transmit the information in protein coding-genes to ribosomes, where that information can be used to make proteins. In this way, RNA can serve as a temporary form of portable storage for the infomation contained in the DNA. You could think of it as very loosely analagous to a computer's RAM, in the limited sense that programs are loaded into RAM before they can be executed, and there are generally many more programs on a hard drive than there are running programs at any given moment. Similarly, just as computers typically have more hard drive space than RAM, the DNA genome for organisms is much longer than any indiviudal RNA. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to its role in information transmission, RNA also plays direct functional roles in the cell. It contributes to the structure of some cellular complexes like the ribosome (which translates RNA into protein). It has also been discovered that RNA can  catalyze (speed up) reactions, a finding for which [Sydney Altman and Tom Cech won the 1989 Nobel Prize in Chemistry](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1989/summary/)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Protein**'s primary roll in cells is to catalyze reactions, and although both RNA and proteins can do so, proteins catalyze many more reactions. This causes reactions that would be energetically favorable anyway to happen much faster than they otherwise would. Protein also plays important roles in cellular structures such as actin filaments."

    "## Important features of biological sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evolutionary relatedness and gene families\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutations are changes in the sequence of the DNA. Where mutations occur is mostly random. Because the DNA in genes is transcribed into RNA, which may then be translated into protein, mutations in the DNA go on to influence the sequence of RNA, and can also influence the amino acid sequence of protein. \n",
    "\n",
    "These changes might substitute one nucleotide with another (e.g. `A` --> `T`), add one or more nucleotides (`A` -> `AAAAAA`), or delete delete one or more nucleotides (`CCAGCA` -> `CC`), or duplicate one or more nucleotides (`CG` -> `CGCG`). \n",
    "\n",
    "This last point - that DNA can be duplicated - means that genes in a cell are not all equally related to one another. Instead, over the course of evolution, single genes are sometimes duplicated into two copies ('gene duplication'). This means that over time, whole families of genes can be produced by gene duplication. These are called *gene families*. Members of the same gene family will tend to have more similar DNA sequences than genes from outside that gene family. Often, members of a given gene family encode proteins with similar functions. As time goes on, members of gene families will undergo mutations that change their sequence, which can lead to changes in the function of the protein or functional RNA that those genes encode. \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Complementarity and base pairing in nucleotide sequences**. \n",
    "\n",
    "A key feature of both RNA and DNA nucleotide sequences (but not amino acids) is complementarity. Consider double-stranded DNA. Each base in one strand must pair with a base in the other strand. But not all pairings are equal. Generally, Adenosine (A) nucleotides pair with Thymidine (T), and Guanine (G) nucleotides pair with Cytosine (C). Biology students memorizing this pattern of complemementation often state it in shorthand based on the letter codes of each nucleotide:\n",
    "\n",
    "> In DNA, A pairs with T, and G pairs with C\n",
    "\n",
    "Base pairing is also important in single stranded RNA. Since there is not another strand to pair with, single stranded RNA can pair with other nucleotides in its own sequence, causing the initially linear RNA to fold up into more complex **secondary structures**. If you hold up the end of a shoelace and fold it back on itself over a finger you will form something that looks like a **stem-loop**, a common type of RNA secondary structure. When RNA pairs with itself, compementation works similarly as in DNA, except that Uracil (U) replaces Thymidine. Thus A pairs with U and C pairs with G.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In RNA, A pairs with U, and G pairs with C\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hydrophobicity and bonds in amino acid sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike DNA and RNA, the amino acids that make up proteins don't link up into complementary pairs. Amino acids do however differ in chemical properties, and those differences are important for the function of the proteins they compose. One key property of amino acids is their degree of [hydrophobicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophobe#:~:text=In%20chemistry%2C%20hydrophobicity%20is%20the,hydrophiles%20are%20attracted%20to%20water.). The word \"hydrophobic\" means water-fearing, and is the antonym of \"hydrophilic\", or water loving. Just like olive oil and vinegar won't easily mix, hydrophobic amino acids will tend to clump together, away from water. They might clump together in the middle of a protein, at the site where one protein touches another, or in a place where a protein touches or passes through another hydrophobic substance, like the interior of the fatty [cell membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane) that encloses our cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some hydrophilic amino acids are either positively or negatively charged. Just like magnets stuck together the wrong way repel one another, amino acids with the same charge will tend to avoid interacting. On the other hand, amino acids of opposite charge can form ionic bonds that hold them together. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other amino acids, called polar amino acids, don't have a full negative or positive charge, but have slight difference in the distribution of charge that makes them partially negative or positive. Such amino acids can interact with one another through hydrogen bonds. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Cysteine amino acids, can form a special kind of durable bond -called a covalent bond- that locks them together with other Cysteine amino acids. The special kind of covalent bond formed by Cysteines is called a disulfide bridge. When present, disulfide bridges are very strong compared to the hydrogen bonds formed by polar amino acids or the ionic bonds formed by charged amino acids.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3D Structure and Chemical Modification\n",
    "\n",
    "Although DNA, RNA and Protein can all be expressed as linear sequences, they also form more complex 3D structures. These structures are oftenimportant for function. The role of complementation and base-pairing in RNA secondary structure was mentioned above. But in addition to this secondary structure, RNA can fold into more complex tertiary structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Protein also has [secondary structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_secondary_structure). These include spiral or sheet-like structures called alpha-helices and beta-sheets. These alpha-helices and beta-sheets can fold further to form the overall 3d structure. Many proteins that are enzymes (e.g. that catalyze a reaction) have an active site where the reaction occurs. Changes to the protein sequence that are in the active site often have a bigger effect on the function of that protein than changes at other locations. This can change their 3d These changes - called conformational changes - may in turn expose sites favorable to binding by other proteins. Finally, the 3d structure of proteins in a cell can be dynamic: steroid receptors like the estrogen receptor, for example, change shape when they bind to estrogen. Similarly, many proteins can become **phosphorylated** by a class of proteins called kinases. This adds phosphate groups which - without changing the amino acid sequence - can alter the proteins 3d shape and therefore sometimes also its function and/or interactions with other proteins.  "
