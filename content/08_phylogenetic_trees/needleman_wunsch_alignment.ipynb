    "# Alignment Matters\n",

    "In written text, spaces matter a lot. For example consider the following nonsense phrase:\n",
    "\n",
    ">HIDING OLD PANTHERS WORDS ARE SHARP \n",
    "\n",
    "It describes the mean words of a hiding feline. Now compare against this one:\n",

    "\n",
    "Now let's think about an evolving DNA sequence. That sequence can undergo several types of mutations. These include substitutions, where one nucleotide in the DNA  is replaced with another (such as A --> T), but can also include insertions - in which a letter is added in the middle of a sequence (such as 'A' -> 'AT')  - or deletions (like 'AT' -> 'A'). \n",
    "\n",
    "Much like the nonsense phrases above, insertions or deletions (collectively known as 'indels') can cause *misalignment* between the letters of an ancestral DNA sequence and its descendants. The process of *sequence alignment* attempts to detect where insertions or deletions have occurred in order to more accurately line up nucleotides that share an evolutionary origin."

    "## Flavors of Sequence Alignment: Global vs. Local Alignment \n",
    "\n",
    "Sequence alignment comes in several different flavors or varieties:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Global sequence alignment** assumes two sequences are homologous (or share a common evolutionary ancestor) across their whole length. It tries to line up the whole thing, from tail to snout. This might be a reasonable assumption for two genes in the same gene family, for instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Local sequence alignment** assumes that there are regions of homology within a bigger sequence, but also regions that do not share common ancestry. This might be a reasonable assumption if checking how many genes two species share. If the species aren't extremely closely related, we would expect that they would share certain genes, but also that there should be large portions of the genome that do not share detectable evolutionary ancestry between the two species (due to large insertions, deletions, inversions or rearrangements). \n",
    "\n",
    "Alignment methods can also be **pairwise** methods, in which two sequences are aligned or **multiple sequence alignments** in which many sequences are aligned together (e.g. all the amino-acyl tRNA synthetase genes in mammals).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we will focus first on global alignment. However, once you understand global alignment in detail, the algorithm for local alignment is similar enough that you can understand that as well, with just a little extra effort. \n",
    "\n",
    "In **pairwise global sequence alignment** we begin with two sequences. These can be DNA, RNA or amino acid sequences. For simplicity, let's focus at first on pairwise global alignment of DNA sequences. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll assume that the full length of our two sequences are homologous, but may contain *insertions* or *deletions* of nucleotides that have caused the homologous positions not to line up with each other. Therefore, our goal is to 'align' or line up these homologous positions in the sequences by adding '-' characters to certain places in each sequence.  These '-' characters will represent places where the two nucleotide sequences become offset from one another (and therefore stop lining up) due to either an extra nucleotide inserted into one, or a nucleotide deleted from the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example. Let's start with two unaligned DNA sequences: `AAAATATTGG` and `TCCTATGG`. If we try to compare sequence identity between these sequences without alignment, we won't see a high level of sequence similarity:\n",
    "\n",
    "`AAAATATTGG` <br>\n",
    "`TCCTATGG`\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, if you compare the nulceotides that line up, you'll see that *none* of them match. If we wanted to formalize this, we could calculate the Hamming Distance between the two sequences (just 1 - the fraction of matching items), and we would find a distance of 1.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet it is probably clear that the sequences have many similarities. If we upload these sequences to a pairwise global alignment web tool (like the EMBOSS one at [EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/services/web/toolresult.ebi?jobId=emboss_needle-I20201212-184827-0832-96343451-p1m)), we might get a result that looks something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`EMBOSS_001         1 AAAATAT----TGG     10\n",
    "                           |    |||\n",
    "EMBOSS_001         1 ------TCCTATGG      8`\n",
    "\n",
    "From a pairswise alignment alone, we can't distinguish whether '-' characters represent insertion in the sequence without the '-' or deletion in the sequence with the '-'. For this reason '-' characters are called *gaps* or *indels* (short for *in*sertion **or** *del*etion)."

    "\n",
    "Before we write code to accomplish a task, it's critical that we understand exactly what we are trying to do. For most algorithms, that means it is extremely important that we work a couple examples by hand before we try to code them. This might seem like extra work, but in fact saves **a ton** of time in the long run. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, before we try to write code to do Needleman-Wunsch alignment, we're going to practice doing it by hand. Don't worry - after the first row or two it will become clear - even obvious - how to do the algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Coding tip for complex code:** If you take the time to really experiment with each python data structure and understand how it works, and take the time to do an algorithm by hand so you understand how it works, and if you build your code step by step in small pieces that you can check as you go, then even very complex algorithms become much easier to put together.\n",

    "##### Settle on a scoring scheme\n",
    "First, we need to settle on a scoring scheme that is based on how much we want to penalize insertion of indels ('-') vs. substitions (e.g. A --> G). We can choose to score all substitutions equally, or assign a different score to some substitutions (e.g. to reflect that biologically transitions are much more common than transversions). Generally, the more common insertions or deletions are biologically, the lower the gap penalty should be. Similarly, the more common substitutions are, the lower the substitution penalty should be. For simplicity in this example, we will use a very simple scoring scheme:\n",

    "- *Gap penalty* = -1 \n",
    "- *Match bonus (all matches)* = 1 \n",
    "- *Mismatch penalty (all substitutions)* = -1 \n",

    "\n",
    "###### Draw a table representing possible alignments\n",
    "Next, we need to draw two tables in which the nucleotides of sequence 1 are on the left side (i.e. they are the row labels) and the nucleotides of sequence 2 are on the top (i.e. they are the column labels). The first will be our 'score matrix' where we keep track of the best possible way to get to the point where each pair of nucletides line up. The second will be our traceback matrix, where we record the set of steps that got us to that optimal score. One trick is that we will have an extra gap ('-') character before each sequence (so the number of rows be one more than the length of sequence 1, and the number of columns will be one more than the length of sequence 2. At the end we will be able to walk back through the traceback matrix to get our optimal alignment.\n",

There is one extra blank row or column before each sequence. At this step, the table is blank. The two sequences are rainbow colored, with each nucleotide being a different color.\">"

    "#### Intuition behind the layout of the scoring matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "One key insight of the Needleman-Wunsch alignment is that all the possible alignments of two sequences from left to right can be represented on this table as paths between the upper left of the table and the lower right of the table. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Meaning of diagonal moves.** If we start in the upper left corner and proceed digonally down the table, that represents an alignment in which we only use *substitutions* (mutations that change one nucleotide into another) to explain the differences between the two sequences. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our specific example, this would mean an alignment that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`1 GCATGCT     7\n",
    "   |  |\n",
    " 1 GATTACA     7\n",
    "`<br>\n",
    "This is a pretty bad alignment (only 2 matches and 5 mismatches). We'll improve on it in a moment, but can you see how the row/column labels you would encounter if you go from top left to bottom right in the table correspond to this alignment? If not, it may be worth trying it by hand step-by-step: the first cell you'd enter in the top left would have a G in both the row and the column. That represents the match between the G's in the top and bottom sequence in the alignment above. The next step would have a C in the column but an A in the row. That would represent the mismatch between C and A in the second position of the alignment. Mistmatches like this indicate that during evolution either the ancestor was a C and one sequence had a C --> A substitution in the bottom sequence, or the ancestor was an A and there was an A--> C substitution in the top sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, any diagonal move we make in heading from the start to the end of the sequence means we are asserting that two nucleotides are homologous (share the same evolutionary origin) and are 'the same thing'. This type of move will improve the alignment score if the nucleotides are the same, but make it worse if they are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meaning of moves to the right**\n",
    "Let's say after starting in the upper-left of the table we took one step to the right, *and then* proceeded as before to travel diagonally down the table. What would that mean for our alignment? If you try this with your finger on the table above, you'll see that the first cell you reach has column label G and now row label. This would indicate that the first G in our first sequence is paired with nothing ('-') in our second sequence. Biologically, this would indicate that the ancestral sequence either had a G and it was lost in the bottom sequence (a deletion) or that the G was added by mutation into the top sequence (an insertion). Now move your finger down and to the right. The next cell you encounter is no longer a pairing of G with G (as before) but now a pairing of the first G in the bottom sequence with the C in position 2 of the top sequence. Effectively, all our other pairings will be 'offset' by 1 due to the insertion in the left sequence.  This will change which positions look like matches vs. mismatches. The alignment corresponding to this 'horizontal 1 then diagonal' path would look like this:\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Finally, the score could have been produced by a move **diagonally down** (representing a match between the two G's). The scoring for diagonal moves is to begin with the score diagonally above, then add the match bonus (here +1) if the two nucleotides in the row and column for that position match, or the mismatch penalty (here -1) for those two nucleotides if they don't match. In this case they do match, so the score for this move is 0 (the score of the cell above and to the left) + the match bonus of 1 = 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Record the best scoring move\n",
    "Finally, we take the highest of these 3 scores and put it into the cell. This represents the best way that previous nucleotides in the two sequences could be aligned up to the current spot of the alignment - in other words the best path to this spot. We also draw an arrow to represent the direction of the best scoring move (here diagonal down). This can either be recorded in another table that is a copy of this one, or you can just draw the arrows into the corners of the cells like I've done below.\n",

    "### How to iterate over our array using nested for loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we try to write actual alignment code, let's make sure we're comfortable iterating over the cells of our array. Basically this means setting up code that lets us visit each cell in the array one by one - like running our finger along a table to read each row one by one from top to bottom. \n",
    "\n",
    "To visit a cell in the table, we need it's *index*, which is the row and column number for that cell. So to visit all the cells, our main challenge is to generate each row and column number one by one. To do this we will set up an outer `for` loop that iterates over each row one by one, setting each row number to a variable (here I call this variable `row_index`, but `i` is most commonly used in real code). Within each loop over the row numbers, an inner `for` loop iterates over each column number one by one and sets its value to a variable (here I use `col_index`, but `j` is most typically used in real code). Inside both loops, we will have a value for the current row and column number. We can use these to index into the scoring array using array indexing (`scoring_array[row_index,column_index]`). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the short code snippet below, let's practice this setup, and use it to number each cell of the array by the order in which we visit it. This can help show us visually what order our code is visiting the cells of our array."

    "The above code assumes - unrealistically - that all nucleotide substitutions are about equally common, and so should be scored equally. However, in reality, some types of substitutions are much more common than others in many biological systems. For example, transitions within purine (A or G) or pyrimidine (C or T) nucleotides tend to be much more common than transversions that cross these classes (e.g. A --> T or G --> C). We can capture such differences by building a scoring function for mismatches.\n",
