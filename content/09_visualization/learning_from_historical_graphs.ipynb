    "A good way to gain familiarity with many different kinds of practical skills is to study, and try to recreate, what others have done in the past. By getting a feel for how to apply these foundational approaches, you'll build up a toolkit that will help you implement your own visualizations. Also, by finding what you like or don't like about past approaches, you can start to find a style that works for you.\n",

This will necessarily be much more visual than other sections. Where they are known, I've tried to add dates for each visualization (BCE stands for 'before the common era' and is equivalent to BC ; CE stands for 'common era' and is equivalent to AD). Smart people (and our Neanderthal relatives) have been visualizing data for a very long time, so it's difficult to organize the wealth of historical visualizations in a way that makes sense. Here I've tried to organize them by theme (counts & values; maps of places & stars; time & events), and then organize each them around selected examples in roughly chronological order. Feel free to skip around or browse as you like.\n",

For example, a king giving another king gift would want to ensure the entire shipment arrived, without any being pilfered along the way by those charged with transporting it. \n",
    "    \n",
    "One ingenious security mechanism involved clay bullae or envelopes. A series of tokens representing trade goods would be placed inside a clay envelope. When the shipment arrived, the recipient could then break open the envelope, count the goods, and make sure the delivery matched what was sent. However, this still left open the possibility that a dishonest trader could break the envelope themselves, remove some tokens (and steal some goods) then reseal the envelop. To prevent this, elaborate seals were carved into rollers by skilled crafters. When these were rolled over the clay envelopes, they produced a unique verifiable pattern that would be much more difficult to replicate without the original seal.\n",

For numerical quipu, positions on the cord represented a base 10 system. The number of knots in each position indicated the number of digits in that position. The type of knot (overhand, or figure eight) also mattered, with special knots used to indicate the ones position. This allowed multiple numbers to be represented in the same cord. These could record sums used in record-keeping of census data. Image by Claus Ableite (Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0)"

She worked at the United States Internal Revenue Service with [various titles](https://medium.com/nightingale/credit-where-credit-is-due-mary-eleanor-spear-6a7a1951b8e6) from 'Draftsman' in the 1920s to Visual Information Specialist in 1952. In her 1952 book [Charting Statistics](https://archive.org/details/ChartingStatistics_201801/page/n177/mode/2up) (p. 166; the full book is out of copyright and available on the Internet Archive). In *Charting Statistics* she illustrated the first description of a box plot, as a variant of a range-bar plot in which interquartile range is also marked. The example applications include salary data within professions. This range-bar plot with interquartile ranges added was later elaborated by John Tukey into the modern boxplot."

Often such graphics implicitly or explicitly put an editorial spin on the data. This is often too mucn for scientific papers, where it is critical that readers be able to consider alternative interpretations of the data. However, to me these results do suggest that there is some benefit to adding memorable visual elements to graphs, as long as the data themselves are still the main graphical element.\n",
