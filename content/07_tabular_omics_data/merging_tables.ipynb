    "In most interesting bioinformatic analyses, the data we want to compare doesn't all start in one place. For example, if we were studying how aging affects the microbiome, perhaps we have one table that tells us how old each patient is, and another that contains a summary of microbiome diversity data for each patient. \n",
    "\n",
    "If there are hundreds or thousands of patients, the order of patients differs between datasets, or if some data are missing (one patient didn't want to give her age, one microbiome amplicon library failed to sequence), it can be very obnoxious to match up these datasets by hand. Worse, it would be easy to make a mistake that might influence your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, `pandas` `DataFrame` objects provide good methods for combining data. Additionally, they include useful tools for filtering your dataset to remove missing data. Both these activities often end up being important parts of larger bioinformatics projects, so it's worth devoting some time to practicing them."

Therefore, folks who work with database languages like `SQL` have developed some vocabulary for describing different types of joins. It's worth learning the basics even if you don't use databases, because the same language is used in many other settings, including in `pandas`.\n",

Even if each of your data sources is 100% complete, they may cover different sets of species, resulting in missing data when you combine them. For example, you might have physiological but not genomic data for one organism, and genomic but not physiological data for another.\n",

    "**Important Note about Statistical Independence and Comparing the Traits of Species**: This trend looks interesting, but to test for significance in this trend we would **have** to use some type of phylogenetic comparative method. This is because all 'regular' statistical methods assume data are statistically independent of each other. However, species evolve on a tree, and have traits that are correlated (NOT independent) of their relatives. This sounds like a minor issue, but actually results in **massive** false positive rates anytime you compare the traits of species without accounting for the structure of the tree. So we should treat our scatterplot as a first insight, but use something like phylogenetic independent contrasts (PIC) or phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) if we wanted to test for significance."
