    "## Overview of the python programming language\n",
    "\n",
    "Many programming languages including Python, the R statistical programming language, C, and Java are commonly used in Bioinformatics research. This project introduces bioinformatics research using python. This general-purpose programming language was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It runs on Windows, Mac OSX and Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are just getting started with coding, python is an excellent language to learn. If you are already experienced with other programming languages, you will find much that is familiar.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what makes distinguishes these different languages? One way programming languages are distinguished is by how they fall into certain common categories. Python, for example, is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose, dynamically-typed programming language. Let's unpack what those terms mean in order to better understand python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**interpreted**. Python is described as an interpreted language. This means that python itself is a program on your computer. When you write a python script, that script is *simply a text file*. By running the python program on your text file, you can tell it to do all sorts of things - run calculations on a genome, generate a graph, etc. This is in contrast to *compiled* languages like C. In those languages, a compiler converts your code into a runnable program. Generally, compiled languages can run faster than interpreted languages. However, being able to rapidly test each version of your script without an extra compiling step can make developing new programs faster. Folks sometimes refer to this as a tradeoff between development time (time spent writing your code) and run time (time the computer spends actually running your code). In many scientific applications, where the number of users is small and new code must be continuously developed, development time is very long compared to run time, and therefore interpreted languages are widely used. (It should also be noted that there are ways to partially achieve some of the speed advantages of compiled languages - check out e.g. PyPy if interested)\n",
    "\n",
    "**high-level**. High level languages mean that the language has many automated methods that automatically handle aspects of how the code you write is implemented by your computer. For example, when we define a variable in python we don't have to worry about allocating memory to store the contents of that variable - python does it for us. This contrasts with other languages like C where memory allocation must be performed manually. Generally speaking, it is much easier to quickly write a working program in a high-level language. However, low-level languages can provide fine-grained control that can help optimize very computationally-intensive programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "**dynamically-typed**. In python, a name like x or my_genome can be associated with objects of any type. This contrasts with statically-typed languages like C or Java. In those languages we must decide that the variable x will always be an integer when we create the variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "So this is what we mean when we say python is an interpreted, high-level, dynamically-typed language. You may notice that many of these features make python scripts fast (and I think *fun*) to write, but slower for your computer to run than some other languages. This is largely why you will find many bioinformatic programs written in python, but few best-selling video games written in the language."

Linnaeus has calculated that if an annual plant produced only two seeds – and there is no plant so unproductive as this – and their seedlings next year produced two, and so on, then in twenty years there would be a million plants. The elephant is reckoned to be the slowest breeder of all known animals, and I have taken some pains to estimate its probable minimum rate of natural increase: it will be under the mark to assume that it breeds when thirty years old, and goes on breeding till ninety years old, bringing forth three pairs of young in this interval; if this be so, at the end of the fifth century there would be alive fifteen million elephants, descended from the first pair.” \n",

    "**Exercise 1** Install Anaconda python on your computer following the directions above. In an interactive session, have python print to the screen the phrase \"Hello World!\". If you can do that you're over one of the critical hurdles in learning any new programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 2** Try running the code for predicting how many bacteria there will be after a given number of divisions, as described above. Then, modify it to answer the following question:  how many bacteria would there be after just 1 day of reproduction? *Hint*: you can modify the part of the code that calculates the total hours of reproduction so it represents just one day instead of two weeks, then rerun the code to figure this out.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Exercise 4** Let's imagine that a tree starts from a seed that is roughly 1 cm tall, and grows at a fixed rate of 1 m per year. Write python code that will calculate how big the tree is after 7 years. *Hint*: you can use the math operations described above to write the equation for a line (y = mx + b), with the number of years being the x variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 5** Pick any simple equation that you have previously learned about. Write python code that calculates the result for you. Check that the answer your code is giving you is correct by comparing it against a hand-calculated answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 6 (slightly more advanced)** Based on the examples above, see if you can figure out how to write your own simple function in python. It could be as simple as adding two numbers x and y, or implementing an equation like the one in Exercise 4. \n",

    "**More on Darwin and the Elephants** Darwin conducted his example using elephants rather than bacteria. As you might imagine there are some important differences between the two that might influence the calculation. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- sexual reproduction, which requires both a male and a female elephant mate to produce offspring. Since only females can give birth, this implies that the ratio of males to females will influence how fast the population increases. To see why, consider a starting population of 5 females and 1 male (who can mate with more than one female) vs. 5 males and 1 female.\n",
    "- multiple reproductions per organisms. A single elephant can reproduce more than once.\n",
    "- delayed reproduction. Elephants cannot reproduce until a certain age.\n",
    "- intrinsic mortality due to aging. We must account for elephants that die due to old age.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, calculating the reproductive output of elephants requires a lot more information than for our bacteria, and although elephants reproducing unchecked would indeed cover the earth quite quickly, Darwin's exact number may only hold for certain narrow assumptions.\n",
