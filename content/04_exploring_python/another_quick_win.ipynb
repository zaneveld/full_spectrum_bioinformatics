Later, we will learn how to filter pandas DataFrames within python to remove rows with non-numeric or missing data. For now, if you encounter this issue in your own data, you can make a 'clean' version by saving the datasheet, and deleting all columns that are not key to your analysis, then deleting rows that have missing data for your `x` or `y` variables. Finally, you would reload the data again with `read_csv`."

This take two lists of numbers, and tests whether the values of the first list are correlated with the corresponding values in the second list. As before, a Pearson regression is useful in comparing two continuous variables against each other, to see if they might be positively or negatively correlated.\n",

    "The Pearson regression produces two values. The R-squared (R2) value represents the proportion of the variation in the y variable that is explained by the value of the x variable. So in this case, 6.7% of the variation in the length of our *Nematostella* can be explained by growth over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The p-value represents the chances of getting this strong of a pattern by chance. In the case of Pearson regression 'by chance' means under the null hypothesis of a flat relationship between the x and y variables (i.e. increasing x does not increase y on average).  In our case we get a p-value of 0.2175. This means it would be quite possible — about a 22% chance — that any apparent increase in size we see over the whole experiment could as easily happen under the null hypothesis of no relationship. Because 22% is much more than 5%, this means that the relationship between time and Nematostella length would not be considered statistically significant."

    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Respond to the following interpretation of the data**: \"Our results show no statistical significance. Therefore, we have ruled out the possibility that *Nematostella* anemones grow over time after fertilization\". Do you agree or disagree with this interpretation? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Examine the graph showing *Nematostella* length over time.**. Does the pattern seem consistent, or do there seem to be contrasting patterns at different points in time?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Test whether *Nematostella* growth patterns differ before and after 20 dpf**. Open the `nematostella_data.csv` file, and save a copy called `nematostella_data_to_20dpf.csv`. In that copy, sort the data by days post fertilization in Excel or Google sheets. Then, save the data to a `.csv` in the same folder as the original data file, and try loading it up by adapting the code above. As before, plot a scatterplot and run a Pearson regression to compare days post fertilization against length. Up to 20 days post fertilization, is Nematostella length increasing over time?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The opacity (opposite of transparency) of points in a matplotlib scatterplot can be adjusted using the `alpha` parameter to the `scatter` function. `alpha` takes a number between 0.0 and 1.0, with 1.0 being totally opaque (= solid, not see-through) and 0.0 being invisible. Try rerunning the scatter function with alpha = 0.25, like this: `scatter(day,length,alpha = 0.25)`. Then, experiment a little with different opacities. What, if anything does making the data points more transparent reveal about the *density* of the data? What alpha values seems best in this case? If you had thousands of data points on a graph, how do you suppose changing the opacity of your scatterplot points might change reader's ability to make sense of the graph?  \n"
