We've also discussed assigning numbers or strings to variables (`x = 7` or `name=\"Jesse\"`), and doing some basic math (`x_squared = x * x`).\n",

You keep going like that until you've added your last item, and then you put a closing square bracket (`]`). Ready to try? Let's make a list of numbers, and a list of strings:"

In our case we get a p-value of 0.00475.

    "1. **Picking a graph to show the effects of a drug vs. a placebo**. Imagine that you are comparing the white blood cell count of two groups of patients: one who was given an experimental drug, and a control group that was given a placebo. Which type of graph do you think would be better to show this data, a boxplot, or a scatterplot? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Testing whether older tigers have bigger territories**. Imagine that you were collecting data on tigers, and trying to test whether older tigers had larger territories than younger tigers. To test whether the age of the tigers was associated with the area of their territory, do you think it would be better to use a t-test for independence, or a Pearson regression? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Make a Boxplot of frog call Length during rainy or clear Weather**. You are studying the mating calls of frogs, and want to graph some data you've collected. Male frogs often make loud calls to attract mates. Imagine that you measured the length of frog calls when it was raining vs. when it was not raining, and wanted to undertand if rain was associated with longer calls. Let's further assume that the call times you measured were: \n",
    "\n",
    "During rain: 3 seconds, 3 seconds, 2 seconds, 4 seconds, 5 seconds\n",
    "No rain: 1 second, 1 second, 1 second, 2 seconds, 1 second\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a boxplot of this data. *Hint*: you can basically reuse the code from the text, just changing the numbers and labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use a t-test to see if frog calls are longer when it is raining**. Using the data from the above exercise, run a t-test for independence to test whether there is a significant difference in frog call length based on whether it's raining or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Three or more category boxplot**. Make up an imaginary dataset with three or more categories. Then try changing the boxplot code to graph all of them at once. *Hint* you'll want to make a list of numbers to represent the data for each category, and assign each list to a variable. Then, you'll want to combine those variables into a single 'data' list, like we combined our control and treatment plant heights in the boxplot example. Finally, you'll want to make sure that you pass in three strings instead of two for your column labels. "
