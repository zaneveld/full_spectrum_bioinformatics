    "\n",
    "This section provides an overview of the most commonly used data types in Python. If you are just learning, don't expect yourself to memorize all this information all at once - the most commonly used data types will be covered in more depth in the chapters where they are used. For now, just read over the examples and let it soak in. You can then refer back to this page if you later encounter one of these data types and need to remember how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are already familiar with other programming languages, and feel comfortable seeking out information  about each data type online, this page may be sufficient to jump-start your exploration of Python.\n",

    "To complete this section you will need:\n",
    "* A computer with Anaconda Python installed. If you aren't set up with Anaconda Python, see [Exploring Python](./exploring_python.ipynb)\n",
    "* To complete the exercise you will need familiarity with basic molecular biology terminology (e.g. DNA, RNA, protein, the Central Dogma). \n",

    "\n",
    "## What is a data type and why do I need one?\n",
    "\n",
    "In our everyday lives, we use all different kinds of data, organized in a variety of ways. We might enter a PIN number to use a debit card. We may keep a TODO list or a list of groceries. If we encounter an unfamiliar term, we might look up its definition in a physical or online dictionary or the glossary of a textbook. Similarly, when tackling a bioinformatics project, we may need to organize many different kinds of data: lists of genes or files, annotations of gene function, or the numerical results of calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "When programming, **data structures** are specific ways of holding and organizing information. Each works best for certain types of data, and each provides different ways of interacting with that data. Becoming fluent in pythons data types - and knowing when to use each - will go a long way towards becoming a productive Python programmer.\n",

    "* when we calculated the mass of an ever-growing ball of bacteria that swiftly swallowed the entire solar system, the decimal number representing that mass was represented by a **float** (float) object. Float objects hold decimal point numbers. Unlike integers, floats are not always perfectly precise (a common computational limitation known as [floating point error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic#Accuracy_problems)).\n",

Data types in python are organized into two main bins: those that are mutable vs. those that are immutable.

    "Much like a physical dictionary let you quickly flip to a particular page and look up the definition of a word, python dictionaries let you rapidly find a *value* (which can be any type of object) from a key (which can be any immutable object). This lookup is extremely fast and memory-efficient, and so gets widely used in python code.\n",

There isn't a direct equivalent in C, though 3rd party libraries implement similar structures.\n",
